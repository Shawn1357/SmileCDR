#
# Property Names below are composed of up to four parts separated by 
# periods ('.'), the first three of which may be in any order (and are expected
# to be in lower-case):
#   1. Property Name      (Required)
#   2. Application Name   (Optional)
#   3. Environment Name   (Optional)
#   4. Index Number       (Optional - must be a positive integer)
#
# 1. Property Name
# ----------------
# The property name is the only required part of an entry in this properties
# file and it is the key by the application will search for values relating
# to that property.  The remaining three components are adornments that are
# optionally added to provide additional specificity across multiple
# applications and/or environments if that is required.
#
# For example: if the properties file contains:
#     sample-property-a = Some Value A
#     sample-property-b = Some Value B
#
# The application would request the values associated with 'sample-property-a'.
#
#
# 2. Application Name
# -------------------
# This is an optional component which identifies properties that are specific
# to a particular application.  This is a convenience if the same proeprty key
# might be used across multiple applications and have different values 
# depending on the application.
#
# The application name itself can be supplied through a command line parameter
#    -c <app-name>   or  --cfgName <app-name>
#
# but would default to a lower-case copy of the simple class name containing
# the Main entry point.  As an example, if you had the following java class
# file:
#
#         package  ca.ontariohealth.sampleapp;
#         ...
#         public class ASampleApp
#         {
#         public static void Main( String[] args )
#             {
#             ...
#             }
#         }
#
# In this case:
#     - The full class name is: ca.ontarionhealth.sampleApp.ASampleApp
#     - The simple class name is: ASampleApp
#     - The app name as it should appear in the properties: asampleapp
#
# As an example, if you have the following properties:
#
#      app-name-1.interesting.property = A Value for App 1
#      app-name-2.interesting.property = A Value for App 2
#      app-name-3.interesting.property = A Value for App 3
#
# And if an application named 'app-name-2' is running and requests the value
# for property 'interesting.property', it will be returned: 'A Value for App 2'
# and the values specific to applications: 'app-name-1' and 'app-name-3' will
# be ignored.
#
#
# 3. Environment Name
# -------------------
# This optional component of a property entry can be used to identify property
# settings for a property name that are environment specific.  For instance,
# you may havce a setting for a property that applies in a development
# environment but have a different value for the same property in a test,
# stage or production environment.
#
# The environment name can only be supplied through the command line parameter
#    -e <env-name>   or   --envName <env-name>
#
# If the environment name is not provided, it is not used and any environment
# specific properties listed in this file will be ignored.
#
# For example, if your app is running in the 'tst' environment and you have
# the following properties listed:
#
#        dev.server.ip.address = 10.1.10.20
#        tst.server.ip-address = 10.2.20.30
#        stg.server.ip.address = 10.3.30.40
#        prd.server.ip-address = 10.4.40.50
#
# And the application requests the value for the property: 'server.ip.address',
# the value '10.2.20.30' will be returned and the other values will be
# ignored.
#
#
# 4. Index Number - Arrays of Values:
# -----------------------------------
# Properties may have any number of values associated with them and make for a
# group of values associated with a single property. To indicate multiple
# values for a single property, an integral index must be appended to the
# end of the property name. For instance:
#
#     property-name.1 = Value 1
#     property-name.2 = Value 2
#     property-name.3 = Value 3
#
#     another-prop    = Value 4
#
# When the application requests the values for 'property-name', it will be
# returned the list of values: ['Value 1', 'Value 2', 'Value 3'].  This list
# may be of any length.
#
# Technically, even when there is no integer suffix to the property, the
# application will still receive a list of values, but that list will
# have length 1.  So requesting 'another-prop' will result in a list of a
# single value: ['Value 4'].
#
#
# Property Lookup Search Mechanism
# --------------------------------
# When an application searches for a property, it searches by the Property Name
# only.  The application does not need to consider the application name or
# the environment name that is associated with.
#
# The triple: Property Name, Environment Name and Property Name may appear
# in any order with the Property and Environment being optional components.
#
# The search order looks for entries in this properties file in the following
# order, moving from most specific to most widely applied property value.
# The search mechanism stops are returns all values with the located
# combination of Application, Environment and Property Names.
#
# For each combination, the application asks itself:
#    - Are all identified components available to the application (only the 
#      Property Name is Required), and
#    - Are there one or more properties which match the specified combination
#      of components (remember, any combination my have an optional integer
#      suffix which indicates an array of values for that combination).
#
# If the answer is no to either of those questions, the current combination
# is skipped and we move on to the next combination.  This process continues
# until a match is found or we run out of combinations to try.
#
#           Specific to a Particular Application and Environment
#           ----------------------------------------------------
#       1.  {App Name}.{Env Name}.{Property}
#       2.  {App Name}.{Property}.{Env Name}
#       3.  {Env Name}.{App Name}.{Property}
#       4.  {Env Name}.{Property}.{App Name}
#       5.  {Property}.{App Name}.{Env Name}
#       6.  {Property}.{Env Name}.{App Name}
#
#           Applicable to either All Environments
#           -------------------------------------
#       7.  {App Name}.{Property}
#       8.  {Property}.{App Name}
#
#           Applicable to either All Applications
#           -------------------------------------
#       9.  {Env Name}.{Property}
#      10.  {Property}.{Env Name}
#
#           Applicable to all Applications and Environments
#           -----------------------------------------------
#      11.  {Property}
#
#
# For example, suppose you have the following set of properties:
#
#      property.nm                 = Generic Value
#      property.nm.app-nm-1        = Generic across all envs for app 'app-nm-1'
#      property.nm.app-nm-2        = Generic across all envs for app 'app-nm-2'
#      property.nm.dev             = Generic across all apps for env 'dev'
#      property.nm.tst.1           = Generic across all apps for env 'tst' - Val 1
#      property.nm.tst.2           = Generic across all apps for env 'tst' - Val 2
#      property.nm.prd             = Generic across all apps for env 'prd'
#      property.nm.dev.app-nm-1    = Specific to app 'app-nm-1' in env 'dev'
#      property.nm.app-nm-2.dev    = Specific to app 'app-nm-2' in env 'dev'
#      app-nm-2.tst.property.nm.1  = Specific to app 'app-nm-2' in env 'tst' - Val 1
#      app-nm-2.tst.property.nm.2  = Specific to app 'app-nm-2' in env 'tst' - Val 2
#
#
#   The an application looking up 'property.nm' having:
#      Name: app-nm-1,  Env: dev  would get: ["Specific to app 'app-nm-1' in env 'dev'"]
#      Name: app-nm-3,  Env: tst  would get: ["Generic across all apps for env 'tst' - Val 1",
#                                             "Generic across all apps for env 'tst' - Val 2"]
#      Name: app-nm-4,  Env: prd  would get: ["Generic Value"]
